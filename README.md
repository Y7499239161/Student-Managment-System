# Student-Managment-System
## Console-Based Student Management System in Java
# Project Overview
The Console-Based Student Management System is a lightweight Java application designed to efficiently manage student records. This system operates in a console-based environment and is ideal for beginners and intermediate Java programmers to practice concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and data manipulation.

### Key Features
Student Record Management

Add new student records.
View all student information.
Update existing student details.
Delete student records.
Search and Sort Functionality

Search for students by roll number, name, or other criteria.
Sort students by:
Roll Number (Ascending/Descending)
Name (Alphabetical Order)
Marks (Highest to Lowest)
Menu-Driven Interface

### Intuitive console-based menu for user-friendly navigation.
Detailed prompts to guide users through each action.
Data Storage

Persistent storage using file handling to save and retrieve data.
Ensures data is retained between application sessions.
Sorting Options

### Choose from various sorting criteria to view records in a specific order:
By Roll Number: Organize records numerically.
By Name: Alphabetical sorting for easy identification.
By Marks: View the highest and lowest scoring students.
### Technology Used
## Programming Language: Java
## Core Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, etc.)
Exception Handling
File Input/Output (I/O)
Collections Framework (e.g., ArrayList, Comparator)
Sample Functionalities
Add a Student

Input: Roll Number, Name, Marks, and other optional details.
Output: Confirmation of successful addition.
View All Students
